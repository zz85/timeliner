# Timeliner

Timeliner is a graphical graphical tool to help create and prototype animations quickly. It is useful for adjusting variables and checking out how the effects changes over time with keyframing and easing/tweening functions. It may also have some similarities with the timeline component of adobe flash, after effects, edge animate or other animation software.

It is written in javascript and meant to work with different javascript libraries or webgl frameworks, in 1d, 2d, or 3d. It is built primary for myself, but feel free to send me suggestions or requests.

## Another js timeline library?

Below are some existing javascript timeline libraries which I think are pretty good. I decided to write mine partly to scratch my itch and partly to challenge myself technically. There are challenges in writing one, but its nice to be in control of your own tools.

1. [Timeline.js](https://github.com/vorg/timeline.js) by Marcin Ignac
2. [Keytime Editor](https://github.com/mattdesl/keytime-editor/) by Matt DesLauriers
3. [Frame.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/frame.js/) by Ricardo Cabello
(Side note: mrdoob's [talk on this](http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/11/8/jsconfasia-2013-mrdoob-ricardo-cabello-framejs) also showcase interesting editors used by the demoscene)
4. [TweenTime](https://github.com/idflood/TweenTime/) by idflood.

I think the current version is much a work in progress. However Ben Schwarz says that a cat dies everytime code doesn't get publish during cssconf asia 2014, so I thought it would be a good idea to release this early.

## Philosophy

I wrote Timeliner to be as lightweight and embedable as possible. Styles, HTML, icons are all embeded in a single javascript file. This means it could work as an included script, bookmarklet, or part of a bigger project. I intent to have interoperablility with other controls tools like dat.gui or gui.js.

## Usage

Include the timeliner.js file.

```js
<script src="timeliner.js"></script>
```

Load data by code, file upload or loading from saved localStorage.

```js
// target is a "pojo" which gets updated when values change.
var target = {
	name1: 1,
	name2: 2,
	name3: 3
};

// initialize timeliner
var timeliner = new Timeliner(target);
timeliner.addLayer('name1');
timeliner.addLayer('name2');
timeliner.addLayer('name3');
```

### Add a keyframe

1. double click on the timeline

or

1. Select a time on the timeline
2. Click on the keyframe

### Add a tween
1. Select time between 2 keyframes
2. Select easing type from the dropdown
